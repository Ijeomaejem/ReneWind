# ReneWind
I led a project focused on optimizing wind energy production through machine learning. By leveraging sensor data on wind turbine generator failures, we developed and fine-tuned classification models to accurately identify potential failures. This enabled proactive repairs, reducing maintenance costs and improving overall operational efficiency.
